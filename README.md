# 🏅 Nobel Prize Data Analysis

This project explores the Nobel Prize dataset to uncover key insights about the laureates.  
Using Python (**pandas**), we analyze patterns across time, categories, gender, and geography.

## 📂 Dataset

The dataset (`nobel.csv`) contains details about Nobel Prize winners from 1901 onwards, including:

- Year of award  
- Category (e.g., Physics, Chemistry, Peace, etc.)  
- Laureate name and gender  
- Birth country and birth date  
- Prize share (whether the award was shared)  

## 🎯 Objectives

- Identify the most commonly awarded gender and country  
- Find the decade with the highest ratio of US-born laureates  
- Discover the category & decade with the most female representation  
- Highlight the first female Nobel laureate  
- List individuals/organizations with multiple Nobel Prizes  

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries
